# Slack Ghosties
##### What is Slack Ghosties? 
A Chrome extension for deleting your Slack messages in bulk groups of ~20 messages at a time.

##### Why did I make Slack Ghosties?
Multiple reasons: 

 - Sometimes I want to ghost off of a Slack. 
 - The UI for deleting messages on Slack is cumbersome -- I expect deliberately so, to discourage people from doing it.
 - Because I wanted to write the simplest possible Chrome extension
 
##### What should you know about Slack Ghosties?

Slack Ghosties going to delete __everything you select, permanently.__ Currently it doesn't prompt you to reconsider, it just deletes everything you select. If you use this, don't come crying to me if you later have regrets.

The pagination is janky. Turns out there's a reason why people use OPC to do that, but I'm enjoying doing it by hand. Sort of. 

Eventually I will extend it to search for files as well as of messages.
